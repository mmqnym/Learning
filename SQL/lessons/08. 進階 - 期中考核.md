# Question 12:

Level: Very difficult

Topic: Uncorrelated subquery

Task: Create a list that shows the "average customer lifetime value" grouped by the different districts.

Example:
If there are two customers in "District 1" where one customer has a total (lifetime) spent of 1000 and the second customer has a total spent of 2000 then the "average customer lifetime spent" in this district is 1500.

So, first, you need to calculate the total per customer and then the average of these totals per district.

Answer: Saint-Denis with an average customer lifetime value of 216.54.

		district,
		SUM(amount) AS per_lifetime_spent
	FROM
		address AS ad
	INNER JOIN customer AS cu
	ON ad.address_id = cu.address_id
	INNER JOIN payment AS pa
	ON cu.customer_id = pa.customer_id
